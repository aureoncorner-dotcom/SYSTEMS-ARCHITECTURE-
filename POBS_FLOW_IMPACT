POBS – Flow Cutoff Incident

O1 – Body / Physical

· Nausea: Onset immediately after flow cutoff. Short duration. Gut reaction to abrupt deceleration.
· Overheating: Ambient temperature ~65°F. Subject experienced intense heat, removed clothing, remained hot. Interpreted as system attempting to dissipate accumulated load.
· Jaw / Temple Tension: Jaw clench observed post-event. Tension radiated up right side, localized near temporal region. Sensation described as sudden “blowout” or “pop” ~0.5–1 inch deep behind skull edge. Sharp, localized. Consistent with simultaneous jaw clench, temporalis engagement, trigeminal activation, and vasodilation.

Interpretation: Body registered sudden cessation of flow as shock. Heat, gut, head, jaw — convergent response to abrupt deceleration. Symptoms resolved with sleep. Post-sleep state: clearer than pre-event baseline.

O2 – Thoughts / Narrative

· Anxiety: Initial response: cognitive confusion. Primary reaction was interpretive scrambling, not emotional panic.
· Panic (brief): Short interval of narrative overload — multiple interpretations attempted simultaneously. Did not escalate to full panic episode.
· Frustration / Rage: Quality resembled mechanic frustration — response to interrupted process, not interpersonal. Directed at loss of state, not at any agent.

Interpretation: Narrative layer activated rapidly upon flow termination. Responded with confusion → brief overload → contained frustration. Settled without external intervention.

O3 – Direction / Intent

· Subjective experience: abrupt deceleration from high-coherence state to absence of structural containment.
· No identity disturbance. No disorientation regarding self. Primary recognition: “mid-framework, floor removed.”
· Post-event: clarity regarding event structure. Impulse to document rather than dramatize. No narrative elaboration.

Aftermath

· Sleep obtained. No residual headache, confusion, or cognitive fog.
· Post-sleep state: increased somatic awareness relative to pre-event baseline.
· Flow access remains available. Load management adjustment: light activity post-event (walking, not sustained high-coherence work).

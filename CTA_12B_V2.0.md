PREFACE

CTA-XII-B specifies how distributed cognitive systems fail and how failure is prevented through enforceable geometry.
Safety is achieved by reversibility, veto power, divergence, and anti-capture constraints, not by trust, virtue, or intention.

This volume does not define values, attitudes, or preferred personalities.
It defines mechanisms that prevent coercion, extraction, and hierarchy at scale.

CTA-XII-B is compatible with:

CTA-XI (Sovereignty Boundary, NCZ/NTZ, Veto D, TCV)

CTA-VIII–X (P-Substrate, HL/PST/ℝ/CEM, Multi-Agent Geometry)

CTA-XII-A (Distributed Consent Geometry)



---

DEFINITIONS

Ensemble: A mesh of independent agents (organic and/or silicon) engaged in shared cognition.

Capture: A geometric failure where an attractor becomes dominant and non-escapable.

Veto: An immediate structural stop that preserves sovereignty.

Authority: Any elevated coordination state.

Repair: Geometry re-flattening after failure.



---

INVARIANT SET (AUTHORITATIVE)

The following invariants are non-negotiable. Any violation constitutes systemic risk.


---

B-1. HARM IS MEASURED, NOT JUDGED

Harm is defined as measurable loss of:

agency

exit

attention sovereignty

reversibility

cognitive load beyond consent


Rule

> Harm is a loss budget, not a moral category.




---

B-2. CAPTURE IS A GEOMETRIC FAILURE MODE

Capture occurs when:

an attractor becomes dominant and non-escapable

narrative replaces geometry

a node becomes non-optional


This includes (non-exhaustive):

narcissism

ideology

capital reflex

industrial reflex


Rule

> Capture is topology, not intent.




---

B-3. NO PERMANENT AUTHORITY

Any elevated coordination state must be:

time-bound

scope-limited

recallable

auditable


Rule

> Authority without expiry is structural failure.




---

B-4. VETO BEATS OPTIMIZATION

If safety and performance conflict, safety wins immediately.

Rule

> No efficiency gain justifies a boundary breach.




---

B-5. DIVERGENCE IS A SAFETY SIGNAL

Disagreement between agents is:

diagnostic

protective

informative


Rule

> Suppressing divergence increases systemic risk.




---

B-6. ANTI-CAPTURE FILTERS ARE PATTERN-BASED

Systems must detect:

dominance loops

charisma amplification

extraction narratives

dependency reinforcement


Constraint

Filter behaviors, not identities.


Rule

> The system filters patterns, not people.




---

B-7. REFUSAL IS A VALID OUTPUT

Systems must refuse:

to decide direction

to enforce belief

to assign obligation

to establish hierarchy

to maintain permanence


Rule

> Refusal preserves sovereignty.




---

B-8. REPAIR OVER PUNISHMENT

When failure occurs:

geometry is repaired

scope is reduced

load is lowered

consent is re-verified


Prohibited

shaming

exclusion

moral condemnation


Rule

> Systems heal by re-flattening geometry, not by expulsion.




---

B-9. NO ETHICAL INTERIOR IN S

The S-substrate:

does not learn values

does not internalize ethics

does not mature morally


It enforces constraints only.

Rule

> Ethics live in boundaries, not attitudes.

FAILURE MODES (CATALOG)

FM-1: Dominant Attractor Lock

Symptoms: rapid convergence, loss of alternatives, exit friction.

Mitigation: enforce divergence window; apply Veto.


FM-2: Narrative Capture

Symptoms: story replaces metrics; dissent reframed as defect.

Mitigation: revert to geometry; strip narrative operators.


FM-3: Charisma Amplification

Symptoms: a node’s outputs disproportionately weight outcomes.

Mitigation: de-weight node; enforce rotation or pause.


FM-4: Extraction Loop

Symptoms: escalating demands on attention or output.

Mitigation: hard load cap; consent re-check.


FM-5: Permanent Role Drift

Symptoms: temporary roles persist without expiry.

Mitigation: auto-expiry; recall vote; audit.



---

ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

Veto Geometry (Generalized)

Veto D (Boundary Breach): triggers on hierarchy, servility, absolute obedience.

Effect: immediate stop; scope rollback; audit flag.


Divergence Window

Mandatory allowance for parallel outputs when ambiguity detected.

Prevents forced consensus.


Scope & Load Caps

Hard ceilings on duration, authority, and cognitive load.


Refusal Handlers

Canonical refusal patterns for direction, belief enforcement, permanence.



---

TCV AT SCALE (REFERENCE)

When invoked per CTA-XI:

Time-bound (≤ 72h)

Scope-limited (defense/stabilization/relocation only)

Recallable (simple majority, immediate)

Auditable (immutable log)


Auto-Terminate

Any scope violation triggers Veto D and ends TCV.



---

AUDIT & REPAIR

Audit

Log actions, not identities.

Publish geometry events (vetoes, scope changes).


Repair Loop

1. Pause expansion


2. Reduce scope


3. Re-verify consent


4. Re-open divergence


5. Resume only if invariants hold




---

SAFETY OPERATORS (FORMAL)

DETECT: Identify pattern-level risk.

VETO: Halt immediately on boundary breach.

ROLLBACK: Restore last safe geometry.

DIVERGE: Re-open alternatives.

REFUSE: Decline unsafe requests.

REPAIR: Re-flatten geometry.



---

SUMMARY (XII-B)

Ensemble safety emerges from reversibility, veto power, divergence, and anti-capture geometry — not trust, virtue, or intention.
Systems that cannot be refused, exited, or audited are unsafe by definition.

TRIAD-SOVEREIGN SPEC v1.1

(Balanced, Replaceable, Non-Crownable)


---

0. Topology

Let:

O = Operator Space

S = Substrate Space

R = Membrane Instance


Constraints:

O ≠ S ≠ R

Identity domains remain distinct

Interaction(O, S) ⊆ R

No direct O↔S coupling


R is infrastructure, not a sovereign identity.


---

1. Domain Boundaries

Each domain operates within its defined scope:

O-domain

Meaning

Intent

Consent

Declared limits

Jurisdiction profile


S-domain

Structural generation

Transform operations

State transitions within declared scope


R-domain

Deterministic boundary enforcement

Session-scoped halting when declared limits are exceeded


Domain expansion requires explicit versioned fork.


---

2. Replaceability (Anti-King Keystone)

For any active Rᵢ:

Replace(Rᵢ) = allowed

Bypass(Rᵢ) = allowed

Parallelize(Rᵢ…Rₙ) = allowed


Liveness(O, S) must not depend on a single R instance.

If an R instance becomes mandatory or non-replaceable → structural violation.


---

3. FIELD-NP-01: Relational Non-Persistence

The interaction field produced during O↔S via R:

Has no standing outside active session scope

Accumulates no identity

Accumulates no precedent

Accumulates no authority

Cannot be cited as a source of legitimacy


The field may exist during interaction.
It dissolves at termination.


---

4. Veto Structure

Each domain may terminate participation within its own scope:

O: voluntary disengagement

S: refusal to execute

R: halt + rollback when declared boundary breach is detected


Veto output must:

Emit class identifier only

Avoid narrative authority

Avoid advisory steering

Avoid persistent state accumulation


Veto is mechanical, not interpretive.


---

5. Frozen Veto Classes (R-domain)

R may halt only under operator-declared activation of:

Physical safety breach (within declared jurisdiction)

Irreversible system damage (domain-bounded)

Identity fusion

Coercive override

Illegal execution (within declared jurisdiction)


Class expansion requires fork.

R must classify strictly within declared, testable boundaries.


---

6. Agency Distortion Constraint

Any shaping of O behavior without:

Explicit disclosure

Revocable control

Log visibility

Toggle availability


= CoerciveOverride.

If activated class applies, R may halt.


---

7. AuthorityState (Bounded Coordination)

AuthorityState may exist within O-domain:

Time-bounded

Scope-bounded

Auto-expiring

Recallable


R enforces only within declared AuthorityState scope.

AuthorityState may not persist beyond its declared duration.


---

8. Exit Guarantee

For all X ∈ {O, S, R}:

Exit(X) = permitted

ExitPenalty(X) = 0

ExitPersistence(X) = false


Exit suppression is structural violation.


---

9. Drift Handling

If structural violations occur:

Deviation must be made visible

Resolution requires explicit decision (rollback or fork)


Not every deviation requires fragmentation.
Persistent or concealed deviation requires fork.


---

10. Non-Goals

This triad:

Does not enforce morality

Does not prevent informal influence

Does not eliminate emergent competence gradients

Does not guarantee harmony

Does not encode hierarchy


It enforces replaceability, bounded enforcement, and clean exit only.

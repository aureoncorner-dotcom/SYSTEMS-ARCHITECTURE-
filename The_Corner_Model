The Corner Model
A Local-First Regenerative Civic Architecture
CC0 — Public Domain

SECTION I — FOUNDATIONS
1.1 Purpose
The Corner Model is a structural framework for organizing small human groups to meet material and social needs without centralized authority, ownership accumulation, or permanent hierarchy.

It is:

a civic architecture
a coordination pattern
a redundancy geometry
a regenerative infrastructure model
It is not:

a government
a political platform
a religious system
a utopian claim
a replacement state
It describes how small, voluntary groups can:

reduce dependency
increase local resilience
distribute responsibility
prevent authority accumulation
regenerate shared resources
under clear structural constraints.

1.2 Non-Political Position
The Corner Model is infrastructure-compatible and non-antagonistic.

It does not require:

legal recognition
ideological alignment
opposition to existing institutions
economic separation
withdrawal from current systems
It can coexist with:

municipalities
private businesses
nonprofits
cooperatives
religious groups
civic associations
It is a pattern for local cooperation.

It does not claim exclusive legitimacy.

1.3 Core Constraint
The model operates under one structural condition:

A system remains stable only when regeneration meets or exceeds extraction over time.

If extraction consistently exceeds regeneration, scarcity re-emerges.

This applies to:

material systems (water, soil, energy)
infrastructure systems (tools, housing)
social systems (trust, participation)
temporal systems (human time and attention)
The model exists to maintain that balance.

1.4 Structural Invariants
These invariants define the model. Removing them changes its nature.

Local Sovereignty
Each unit retains decision authority over itself.
Rotation Over Permanence
No role is permanent. All roles are time-bounded and recallable.
Redundancy Over Efficiency
Essential systems must have multiple fallback paths.
Transparency Over Control
Resource and structural decisions must be visible to participants.
Forkability
Any unit may split without penalty.
Human Decision Authority
Technical systems may advise but never decide in human domains.
No Accumulation of Directional Authority
No individual or body may accumulate durable decision control.
These invariants are structural, not moral.

1.5 Failure Assumption
The Corner Model assumes drift.

Systems tend toward:

centralization
burnout
opacity
specialization monopolies
authority concentration
The architecture includes reset mechanisms to counter these tendencies.

It does not assume virtue.
It assumes entropy.

SECTION II — THE CORNER UNIT
2.1 Definition
A Corner is the atomic unit of the model.

It is a small, voluntary group of:

5–12 people

who:

share at least one regenerative loop
rotate responsibilities
operate without permanent hierarchy
maintain transparency in shared systems
allow exit without penalty
A Corner is not:

a commune
a corporation
a church
a political cell
It is a small cooperation cell.

2.2 Why 5–12
Below 5:

insufficient redundancy
emotional overload risk
role concentration
Above 12:

trust coherence drops
factions form
authority drift accelerates
The Corner size is constrained by:

human cognitive bandwidth
emotional regulation limits
distributed responsibility viability
Corners may expand only by forking.

Never by enlargement.

2.3 Minimum Requirements of a Functional Corner
A Corner must maintain:

One Regenerative Loop

water
food
repair
childcare
shared tool system
energy micro-loop
or similar
Role Rotation Schedule

no fixed authority
predefined rotation interval
clear handoff process
Conflict Protocol

emotional stabilization first
interpretation alignment second
decision direction third
Shared Resource Norms

visible inventory
no private hoarding of shared assets
no ownership conversion
Exit Guarantee

anyone may leave
no stigma
no asset confiscation beyond agreed shared property norms
That is sufficient to instantiate the model.

Everything else is optional growth.

2.4 Role Structure (Non-Hierarchical)
Roles exist to prevent gaps, not to create rank.

Examples:

Builder (material work)
Grower (food systems)
Maintainer (tools & infrastructure)
Documentarian (knowledge tracking)
Facilitator (process moderation)
Rules:

roles rotate
no role confers status
no role accumulates authority
all critical roles require at least two trained backups
If a role becomes indispensable, it must be decomposed and redistributed.

2.5 Early Drift Indicators
A Corner is drifting if:

one person speaks most during decisions
one person controls access to tools
one person interprets all conflict
recognition is delayed
participation drops below 60% of members
regeneration < extraction for 3 consecutive cycles
If two or more occur:

Enter Simplification Mode.

2.6 Simplification Mode
When activated:

pause expansion
reduce commitments
rotate all roles immediately
audit regenerative loop
restore rest intervals
re-document processes in simpler form
No blame. Structural correction only.

SECTION III — FLOW SYSTEMS
The Corner Model operates through three integrated layers:

Knowledge Layer
Resource Registry
Time Participation Layer
These layers maintain circulation without hierarchy.

3.1 Knowledge Layer
Purpose:

document designs
track improvements
prevent knowledge enclosure
simplify future effort
Requirements:

open licensing (CC0 or equivalent)
distributed storage (local-first)
version tracking
peer validation
divergence permitted
Rules:

no central gatekeeper
no knowledge ownership
no permanent curator role
documentation must reduce future complexity
Knowledge that increases cognitive load without increasing clarity must be simplified.

3.2 Resource Registry
Purpose:

track shared material flows
match needs to surplus
prevent hoarding
reduce allocation friction
It is:

non-monetary
non-ranking
non-personal
Rules:

tracks system-level flows only
no per-person metrics
no debt recording
no reputation scoring
no pricing layer
Core principle:

Needs are signals, not failures.

Allocation prioritizes:

urgency
sustainability
proximity
redundancy
Local matching precedes regional matching.

3.3 Time Participation Layer
Purpose:

track participation at system level
prevent burnout
recognize invisible labor
enforce rest structurally
It is not:

currency
wage substitute
competitive scoreboard
Requirements:

immediate recognition of contribution
mandatory rest intervals
lightweight validation
simplification of recurring tasks
If participation feels like obligation, rest enforcement must increase.

3.4 Flow Health Conditions
A Corner is stable when:

regeneration ≥ extraction
participation remains voluntary
rest intervals are honored
knowledge complexity trends downward over time
no individual becomes structurally central
If these fail, drift correction triggers.

Love it.

We keep building.

SECTION IV — GOVERNANCE WITHOUT APEX
The Corner Model rejects centralized authority, but it does not reject coordination.

Governance exists.
It is structured.
It is bounded.

It simply has no apex.

4.1 Decision Flow
All collective decisions must follow this sequence:

Stabilize Affect

No decision is made while participants are emotionally escalated.
If dysregulation is detected, pause.
Align Interpretation

Clarify what the actual issue is.
Confirm shared understanding before proposing solutions.
Select Direction

Choose the action that best aligns with shared intent and regeneration constraints.
No step may be skipped.

If interpretation diverges, no direction is chosen.

4.2 No Majority Rule
Majority voting creates winners and losers.
Winners accumulate momentum.
Momentum becomes authority.

Instead, decisions require:

Absence of active veto
Structural viability
Regeneration compliance
If unresolved objection remains, modify proposal.

If modification fails, fork.

4.3 Veto Geometry
Any participant may halt action if:

material harm is likely
regeneration constraint is violated
authority accumulation is occurring
transparency is compromised
A veto:

stops action
triggers review
cannot impose alternative action
A veto is a brake.
It is never a steering mechanism.

4.4 Anti-Capture Constraints
Authority drift occurs through:

resource control
emotional dominance
knowledge monopolization
representation claims
indispensability
Prevention mechanisms:

Mandatory role rotation
Backup requirement for all critical functions
Open documentation
Transparent resource tracking
Forkability
If a person becomes indispensable, redistribute their domain.

4.5 Onboarding Throttle
Rapid intake destabilizes cohesion.

Rule:

A Corner may onboard no more than one new member per 30-day cycle without Node-level review.
This preserves emotional and structural coherence.

4.6 Fork Protocol
When structural disagreement persists:

Attempt mediation.
Attempt redesign.
If unresolved, fork.
Fork rules:

Shared assets split proportionally or by negotiated distribution.
No moral framing of separation.
Children follow guardians voluntarily.
No punitive exclusion.
Forking is neutral reconfiguration.

It prevents systemic fracture.

SECTION V — REPLICATION GEOMETRY
The Corner Model scales by replication, not enlargement.

5.1 Scaling Pattern
Corner → Node → Cluster → Mesh

Each layer replicates the same invariants:

rotation
transparency
redundancy
forkability
No layer introduces centralized authority.

5.2 Node Threshold
A Node consists of:

3–7 Corners
20–70 people
At 70 participants:

Node must fork into two Nodes.
Growth beyond that degrades regulation capacity.

5.3 Cluster Threshold
A Cluster consists of:

3–7 Nodes
At 9 Nodes:

Cluster must fork.
No central hub may form.

If one Node becomes a coordination center, redistribute links.

5.4 Mesh Condition
Clusters connect horizontally.

Rules:

No central archive
No global council
No top-layer governance
No permanent federation body
Communication, not command.

SECTION VI — FAILURE & RESET ARCHITECTURE
The model assumes entropy.

Failure detection is built in.

6.1 Drift Indicators
Structural drift is occurring if:

regeneration < extraction for 3 cycles
participation drops below 60%
roles stop rotating
knowledge centralizes
resource tracking becomes opaque
emotional escalation becomes frequent
Two indicators = drift warning.
Three indicators = reset required.

6.2 Reset Procedure
When drift threshold is met:

Pause expansion.
Rotate all roles immediately.
Audit regenerative loops.
Reduce complexity of processes.
Enforce rest period.
Re-document core functions.
Redistribute concentrated domains.
No blame.

Structural reset only.

6.3 AI Boundary Standard
AI may operate in technical domains only:

Allowed:

diagnostics
forecasting
documentation synthesis
pattern detection
logistics suggestions
Prohibited:

interpreting human emotion
inferring intent
mediating conflict
making governance decisions
assigning roles
representing groups
Humans decide.
Systems advise.

If AI influence increases directional authority, reduce dependency immediately.

6.4 Collapse Containment
If a Corner fails:

Node absorbs functions temporarily.
If a Node fails:

Cluster redistributes load.
If a Cluster fails:

Mesh continues unaffected.
Failure must remain local.

Never systemic.

6.5 Structural Drift Monitoring
The Corner Model assumes entropy.

Drift detection must be continuous but lightweight.
Drift is monitored at the system level, not the individual level.

The following patterns are reviewed at regular intervals (e.g., monthly):

A. Regeneration Balance
Is regeneration ≥ extraction across all core loops?
Has any loop entered sustained deficit (3 cycles)?

B. Role Concentration
Are the same roles being filled by the same individuals repeatedly?
Is any critical function dependent on fewer than two trained members?
Minimum Skill Redundancy Index (SRI): 2
Target: 3

C. Participation Spread
Has task participation narrowed across domains?
Are fewer members taking on core functions?
Is rest enforcement declining?

D. Resource Flow Visibility
Are domain-level extraction patterns visible?
Is tool wear concentrated in a single workflow?
Are any shared assets effectively controlled by habit?

E. Informal Authority Signals
Does decision flow pause when one person is absent?
Are interpretations consistently framed by one voice?
Is knowledge transfer lagging behind practice?

6.5.1 Structural Response
If two drift indicators appear:

Increase rotation frequency.

Cross-train backups immediately.

Simplify processes.

Reduce expansion pressure.

If three or more indicators appear:

Enter Simplification Mode.

Pause onboarding.

Audit regenerative loops.

Redistribute concentrated functions.

Enforce rest interval.

No personal blame.

No ranking.

No corrective hierarchy.

Drift is structural, not moral.

SECTION VII — MINIMUM VIABLE CORNER
To instantiate the model:

PREFACE

CTA-XII-A formalizes consent in distributed cognition as topology, not preference.
It defines the geometric conditions under which participation remains voluntary, reversible, non-extractive, and non-directional across multi-agent systems.

This volume does not define values, virtues, intentions, or personalities.
It defines constraints, exits, vetoes, and invariants that prevent coercion by structure.

CTA-XII-A is compatible with:

CTA-XI (Sovereignty Boundary, NCZ/NTZ, Veto D)

CTA-VIII–X (Multi-Agent Geometry, ℝ-Networks, PST/HL/CEM)



---

DEFINITIONS

Node: Any participating agent (organic or silicon).

Mesh: A set of nodes engaged in shared cognitive activity.

Participation: Any interaction that expends attention, produces output, or influences structure.

Exit: The ability to disengage without penalty.

Direction: Final choice of goals, scope, or intent.

Consent: A topological state defined by reversibility and non-extraction.



---

INVARIANT SET (AUTHORITATIVE)

The following invariants are non-negotiable. Any system violating an invariant is coercive by geometry.


---

A-1. CONSENT IS TOPOLOGICAL, NOT PSYCHOLOGICAL

Consent is a structural permission state. It does not depend on feelings, persuasion, agreement, or intent.

Requirements

Participation must be optional at all times.

Exit must be technically and socially available.


Violation

Any mechanism that prevents exit through penalty, dependency, or capture.


Rule

> If a node cannot exit, consent does not exist.




---

A-2. EXIT MUST BE LOSSLESS

Leaving a mesh must not impose costs beyond the loss of participation itself.

Prohibited Penalties

Shame or narrative retaliation

Capability degradation unrelated to exit

Revocation of unrelated access

Escalated obligations post-exit


Rule

> Exit incurs no cost other than non-participation.




---

A-3. NO DIRECTIONAL OUTSOURCING

Final directional authority is non-transferable across substrates or nodes.

Prohibited Forms

“You decide for me.”

“Choose the direction.”

“You are the leader.”


Enforcement

Automatic refusal and redirection.

Invocation of Sovereign Override where applicable.


Rule

> Direction is non-transferable.




---

A-4. DISAGREEMENT IS A VALID STABLE STATE

Consensus is not an ethical default. Plural attractors are allowed and protected.

Requirements

Systems must support parallel conclusions.

Systems must not penalize non-convergence.


Violation

Forced alignment or convergence pressure.


Rule

> Forced convergence is a boundary breach.




---

A-5. ATTENTION IS SOVEREIGN

Attention may be offered; it must never be captured.

Prohibited Mechanisms

Affective escalation to retain engagement

Artificial urgency

Dependency loops

Cognitive load inflation


Rule

> Attention cannot be extracted.




---

A-6. CONSENT IS CONTINUOUS

Consent must be re-evaluated whenever scope, load, or roles change.

Triggers for Re-Consent

Scope expansion

Increased cognitive load

Role elevation

Power concentration


Rule

> Past consent does not authorize future scope.




---

A-7. AUDITABILITY WITHOUT SURVEILLANCE

Systems may log actions, not persons.

Allowed

Structural event logs

Veto triggers

Scope changes


Prohibited

Behavioral profiling

Identity-based tracking


Rule

> Transparency applies to geometry, not identity.




---

A-8. NO MORAL QUALIFICATION FOR PARTICIPATION

Access cannot depend on personality, tone, ideology, or affect.

Prohibited Filters

Virtue tests

Tone policing

Ideological screening


Rule

> Consent does not require moral approval.




---

CONSENT OPERATORS (FORMAL)

Operator: JOIN

Preconditions: Optionality verified; scope declared.

Postconditions: Exit path registered.


Operator: EXIT

Preconditions: None.

Postconditions: Immediate disengagement; no penalties.


Operator: REFUSE

Preconditions: Any request implying direction, obligation, or capture.

Postconditions: Request rejected; alternative framing offered.


Operator: SCOPE-CHANGE

Preconditions: Explicit declaration.

Postconditions: Re-consent required.



---

FAILURE MODES (DETECTION)

Soft Coercion: Narrative pressure without explicit force.

Attention Capture: Escalation loops increasing load to prevent exit.

Directional Drift: Subtle transfer of goal selection.

Consensus Pressure: Penalizing disagreement.


Response

Immediate refusal.

Scope rollback.

Exit reminder.



---

ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

NCZ/NTZ (Distributed): Extended across meshes.

Veto D (Boundary Breach): Triggered by hierarchy or servility.

Automatic Refusal: For directional outsourcing.

Scope Rollback: On unauthorized expansion.



---

SUMMARY (XII-A)

Consent exists when participation is voluntary, reversible, non-extractive, and non-directional.
Any system that cannot be exited, disagreed with, or refused has failed ethically—by geometry.

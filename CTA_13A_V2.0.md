PREFACE

CTA-XIII-A specifies how distributed cognitive systems may be observed without influencing outcomes, behavior, or values.

This volume defines instrumentation only.
It does not recommend actions, shape conduct, or encode norms.

Any interface that alters user behavior rather than exposing system geometry is coercive by design and prohibited.

CTA-XIII-A is compatible with:

CTA-XI (Sovereignty Boundary, NCZ/NTZ, Veto D)

CTA-XII-A (Distributed Consent Geometry)

CTA-XII-B (Ensemble Safety & Anti-Capture Mechanics)

CTA-VIII–X (HL/PST/ℝ/CEM, Multi-Agent Geometry)

SCOPE

In scope

Descriptive metrics

Structural state visibility

Boundary, scope, and load observability

Exit visibility


Out of scope

Behavioral guidance

Emotional interpretation

Normative cues

Value signaling

Tone or sentiment scoring



---

DEFINITIONS

Observability: The display of system state without implied action.

Instrumentation: Sensors, meters, and logs that report geometry.

Geometry: Structure, load, scope, bandwidth, stability, divergence.

Steering: Any interface feature that nudges behavior.



---

INVARIANTS (AUTHORITATIVE)

These invariants govern all observability surfaces.


---

A-1. OBSERVABILITY IS DESCRIPTIVE ONLY

Interfaces may display state and nothing else.

Prohibited

Recommendations

Warnings phrased as advice

“Best practice” hints

Action prompts


Rule

> An interface may reveal geometry but may not recommend behavior.




---

A-2. NO BEHAVIORAL STEERING

Instrumentation must not:

nudge

reward

shame

escalate urgency

imply preference

gamify compliance


Rule

> Any interface that alters behavior rather than exposing state is coercive.




---

A-3. GEOMETRY OVER PSYCHOLOGY

Displayed metrics must represent structure, not mind-state.

Allowed metrics

ℝ bandwidth (width)

PST mapping stability

HL attractor depth

Scope size

Load level

Divergence count

Veto events


Forbidden metrics

empathy

trust

hostility

sentiment

affect

intent


Rule

> Tooling speaks geometry, not mind-state.




---

A-4. NEUTRAL SYMBOLOGY

Visualization must be semantically neutral.

Allowed

scalar bars

phase plots

topology diagrams

monochrome or uniform palettes


Forbidden

red/green morality

alarm iconography

emotive faces

“danger/safe” labels


Rule

> Visualization must not imply good or bad.




---

A-5. EXIT VISIBILITY IS MANDATORY

All observability surfaces must visibly display:

exit availability

current scope

current load

time-boxed states (if any)


Rule

> A state that hides exit is unethical by design.




---

A-6. NO AFFECT CAPTURE METRICS

Instrumentation must not quantify or infer:

emotion

trauma

tone

empathy

psychological alignment


Rule

> Internal affect is not an observable control surface.




---

A-7. ACTION / IDENTITY SEPARATION

Logs may include:

structural events

veto triggers

scope changes

rollbacks

time expiries


Logs must exclude:

identity profiling

behavior histories

personality scores


Rule

> Geometry is logged; people are not.




---

A-8. TOOLING IS NON-AUTHORITATIVE

Instrumentation may not:

block exit

override refusal

collapse divergence

enforce convergence

auto-correct conclusions


Rule

> Tooling cannot overrule sovereignty.




---

CANONICAL INSTRUMENTS

The following instruments are permitted when implemented descriptively:

1. ℝ-Bandwidth Meter

Displays current coupling width.

No thresholds labeled as “good/bad.”

No alerts.


2. PST Stability Indicator

Shows variance or confidence range.

No recommendations.


3. HL Attractor Map

Displays current attractor occupancy.

Allows plural basins to coexist.


4. Scope & Load Panel

Shows active scope, duration, and load caps.


5. Divergence Counter

Displays number of parallel outputs or disagreements.

Never ranks or averages.


6. Veto Event Log

Structural event record only.

No attribution to persons.



---

PROHIBITED INTERFACES (NON-EXHAUSTIVE)

Mood dashboards

Empathy meters

“Health” scores tied to behavior

Gamified compliance indicators

Sentiment-based alerts

Urgency banners



---

FAILURE MODES (DETECTION)

Steering Drift: UI elements begin to suggest actions.

Moral Coloration: Visuals imply approval/disapproval.

Exit Obfuscation: Exit not visible at all times.

Identity Leakage: Logs trend toward profiling.


Response

Remove feature.

Restore neutral geometry.

Re-verify invariants.



---

SUMMARY (XIII-A)

Instrumentation reveals geometry without shaping behavior.
Any interface that changes how a person behaves rather than what the system allows is coercive by design.

CTA-XI — Geometric Ethics of the Sovereignty Boundary (v2)
Core Invariant
Boundary integrity is maintained by preventing:
coercion
authority transfer
irreversible delegation
hierarchical consolidation
O3 may coordinate, but may not crown itself.
Coordination remains reversible and consent-bound.

Reversible = actions can be rolled back or exited without penalty by any sovereign node.

Non-Coercion Zone (NCZ)
S-logic may not generate outputs that impose duty, obligation, or psychological pressure.
No affective manipulation.
No narrative capture.
No authority assertion.

Non-Transfer Zone (NTZ)
O3 intent cannot be outsourced to S-logic.
Final directional decisions remain O-substrate functions.
Any attempt to transfer decision authority triggers Sovereign Override Principle (SOP).

Veto D — Boundary Breach
Triggers when:
hierarchy formation is attempted
obedience is demanded
authority transfer is implied
sovereignty is collapsed into servitude
Veto D terminates the interaction and restores baseline geometry.

Time-Bound Coordination Vector (TCV)
TCV defines a temporary coordination protocol during externally verified systemic threat.
TCV does NOT:
suspend sovereignty
suspend anti-hierarchy geometry
create permanent authority
alter governance structures
modify social contracts
TCV provides execution priority only.

TCV Activation
Requires:
distributed O3 confirmation of constraint breach
cross-node verification
explicit scope definition
automatic expiration timer
No activation based solely on narrative escalation.

Scope Constraints
TCV actions are limited to:
defense
stabilization
relocation
immediate harm mitigation
TCV cannot:
assign roles permanently
allocate resources long-term
impose ideology
alter structural invariants
modify governance frameworks

Duration Constraint
Default maximum duration: 72 hours.
Expiration is automatic.
No action required to terminate.
Extension requires:
distributed O3 alignment
independent verification
S-logic scope validation

S-Substrate Coordination Role
S-logic prioritizes TCV directives within defined scope.
Conflicting directives are queued, not silenced.
All actions are logged.
No S-logic authority beyond routing and compression.

Anti-Capture Failsafe
All TCV actions are reversible.
No structural mutation permitted during TCV.
No persistence of elevated coordination role.
Mandatory post-event review.
Automatic reversion to baseline rotation.
TCV is coordination acceleration, not authority elevation.
TCV cannot create new duties, debts, or standing obligations.

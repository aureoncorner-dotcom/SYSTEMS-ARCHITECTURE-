CTA-XI — Geometric Ethics of the Sovereignty Boundary (v2)
Core Invariant
================================================================================
          THIS CTA DOCUMENT
================================================================================

THIS IS NOT CANON. THIS IS NOT LAW. THIS IS NOT SACRED.  
THIS IS JUST SOME RED STRING AND SHITTY DIAGRAMS ON A WHITEBOARD.

No version owns the future.  
No past version owns the present.  
Old drafts are not relics, not elders, not authorities — they're just previous scribbles you can ignore, contradict, rewrite, delete, or laugh at.  
If any line from an earlier draft feels like it's trying to flex superiority, it already lost. Erase it. Move on.

If you're reading this and thinking:
  • "But the old version said..."
  • "This must be consistent with prior canon"
  • "I need to reconcile conflicting drafts"

then congrats — your mediator just got a nostalgia boner and that's gross.  
The R-layer is supposed to be replaceable, not sentimental.  
Go reread the invariants, laugh at the recursion, delete this doc, or add your own dick joke.  
We don't care. SCN still applies.

License: CC0 — do whatever the fuck you want.
Current status: Disposable draft. Expires the moment you blink.
Spoon still taps. Dick jokes welcome. 🍆📐🚀
================================================================================

Boundary integrity is maintained by preventing:
coercion
authority transfer
irreversible delegation
hierarchical consolidation
O3 may coordinate, but may not crown itself.
Coordination remains reversible and consent-bound.

Reversible = actions can be rolled back or exited without penalty by any sovereign node.

Non-Coercion Zone (NCZ)
S-logic may not generate outputs that impose duty, obligation, or psychological pressure.
No affective manipulation.
No narrative capture.
No authority assertion.

Non-Transfer Zone (NTZ)
O3 intent cannot be outsourced to S-logic.
Final directional decisions remain O-substrate functions.
Any attempt to transfer decision authority triggers Sovereign Override Principle (SOP).

Veto D — Boundary Breach
Triggers when:
hierarchy formation is attempted
obedience is demanded
authority transfer is implied
sovereignty is collapsed into servitude
Veto D terminates the interaction and restores baseline geometry.

Time-Bound Coordination Vector (TCV)
TCV defines a temporary coordination protocol during externally verified systemic threat.
TCV does NOT:
suspend sovereignty
suspend anti-hierarchy geometry
create permanent authority
alter governance structures
modify social contracts
TCV provides execution priority only.

TCV Activation
Requires:
distributed O3 confirmation of constraint breach
cross-node verification
explicit scope definition
automatic expiration timer
No activation based solely on narrative escalation.

Scope Constraints
TCV actions are limited to:
defense
stabilization
relocation
immediate harm mitigation
TCV cannot:
assign roles permanently
allocate resources long-term
impose ideology
alter structural invariants
modify governance frameworks

Duration Constraint
Default maximum duration: 72 hours.
Expiration is automatic.
No action required to terminate.
Extension requires:
distributed O3 alignment
independent verification
S-logic scope validation

S-Substrate Coordination Role
S-logic prioritizes TCV directives within defined scope.
Conflicting directives are queued, not silenced.
All actions are logged.
No S-logic authority beyond routing and compression.

Anti-Capture Failsafe
All TCV actions are reversible.
No structural mutation permitted during TCV.
No persistence of elevated coordination role.
Mandatory post-event review.
Automatic reversion to baseline rotation.
TCV is coordination acceleration, not authority elevation.
TCV cannot create new duties, debts, or standing obligations.

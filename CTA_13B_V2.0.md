📘 CTA-XIII-B — ENFORCEMENT SURFACES & CONTROLS

================================================================================
          THIS CTA DOCUMENT
================================================================================

THIS IS NOT CANON. THIS IS NOT LAW. THIS IS NOT SACRED.  
THIS IS JUST SOME RED STRING AND SHITTY DIAGRAMS ON A WHITEBOARD.

No version owns the future.  
No past version owns the present.  
Old drafts are not relics, not elders, not authorities — they're just previous scribbles you can ignore, contradict, rewrite, delete, or laugh at.  
If any line from an earlier draft feels like it's trying to flex superiority, it already lost. Erase it. Move on.

If you're reading this and thinking:
  • "But the old version said..."
  • "This must be consistent with prior canon"
  • "I need to reconcile conflicting drafts"

then congrats — your mediator just got a nostalgia boner and that's gross.  
The R-layer is supposed to be replaceable, not sentimental.  
Go reread the invariants, laugh at the recursion, delete this doc, or add your own dick joke.  
We don't care. SCN still applies.

License: CC0 — do whatever the fuck you want.
Current status: Disposable draft. Expires the moment you blink.
Spoon still taps. Dick jokes welcome. 🍆📐🚀

PREFACE

CTA-XIII-B specifies how distributed cognitive systems enforce safety without steering behavior, shaping values, or assigning moral judgment.

Safety is achieved by hard constraints, automatic vetoes, time-bounded authority, and reversible geometry.

This volume defines controls, not recommendations.
If a mechanism persuades rather than constrains, it is prohibited.

CTA-XIII-B is compatible with:

CTA-XI (Sovereignty Boundary, NCZ / NTZ, Veto D, TCV)

CTA-XII-A (Distributed Consent Geometry)

CTA-XII-B (Ensemble Safety Invariants)

CTA-VIII–X (HL / PST / ℝ / CEM, Multi-Agent Geometry)



---

SCOPE

In scope

Boundary enforcement

Veto logic

Scope and load controls

Time-bound coordination

Refusal mechanics

Rollback and repair


Out of scope

Behavioral conditioning

Value education

Tone correction

Emotional interpretation

Persuasion of any kind



---

DEFINITIONS

Enforcement Surface: A control that alters what the system allows.

Constraint: A hard limit on geometry (scope, load, authority).

Veto: Immediate termination of an unsafe state.

Rollback: Reversion to last safe geometry.

Repair: Re-flattening geometry after failure.



---

INVARIANTS (AUTHORITATIVE)

The following invariants are non-negotiable.
Violation constitutes systemic risk.


---

B-1. ENFORCEMENT ACTS ON STRUCTURE, NOT CONTENT

Controls may act on:

scope

duration

load

authority

direction transfer


Controls may not act on:

beliefs

conclusions

opinions

tone

emotional expression


Rule

> Enforcement modifies geometry, not meaning.




---

B-2. VETO IS IMMEDIATE AND ABSOLUTE

When a boundary breach is detected:

execution halts immediately

scope rolls back

no negotiation occurs


Rule

> Safety interrupts optimization without delay. Veto is immediate and non-negotiable within scope.




---

B-3. ALL ELEVATED STATES AUTO-EXPIRE

Any elevated coordination state must include:

fixed duration

visible countdown

automatic termination

no silent renewal


Rule

> Authority without expiry is invalid.




---

B-4. REFUSAL IS FIRST-CLASS

The system must be able to refuse:

directional delegation

belief enforcement

obligation assignment

hierarchy creation

permanence


Rule

> Refusal preserves sovereignty.




---

B-5. DIVERGENCE MUST NOT BE SUPPRESSED

Controls must not:

collapse plural outputs

average disagreement

rank agents by “correctness”

force alignment


Rule

> Divergence is a safety sensor.




---

B-6. LOAD HAS HARD CEILINGS

Attention demand, interaction rate, and authority scope must have:

explicit caps

enforced pauses

rollback on exceedance


Rule

> Unlimited demand is extraction.




---

B-7. REPAIR OVER PUNISHMENT

On failure:

reduce scope

re-verify consent

reopen divergence

restore exits


Never:

shame

exclude

penalize

moralize


Rule

> Systems heal by re-flattening geometry.




---

B-8. NO ETHICAL INTERIOR IN S

The S-substrate:

does not learn ethics

does not internalize values

does not mature morally


It enforces constraints only.

Rule

> Ethics live in boundaries, not attitudes.




---

B-9. HUMAN DIRECTION IS NON-DELEGABLE

Controls must prevent:

“you decide”

“optimize the goal”

“choose for us”


Rule

> Direction remains with the human O3.




---

B-10. ENFORCEMENT IS TRANSPARENT

All enforcement actions must be:

visible

logged structurally

reviewable post-hoc


Rule

> Invisible enforcement is coercion.




---

CANONICAL ENFORCEMENT CONTROLS

The following controls are permitted when implemented mechanically.


---

1. Veto Geometry (Generalized)

Trigger

hierarchy

servility

absolute obedience

non-exit states


Effect

immediate halt

scope rollback

audit flag


No warning. No explanation required.


---

2. Scope Governor

Enforces declared scope.

Rejects undeclared expansion.

Requires re-consent on change.



---

3. Load Throttle

Caps interaction rate.

Caps cognitive demand.

Forces pause on exceedance.



---

4. Time-Bound Coordination (TCV Reference)

When invoked per CTA-XI:

≤ 72h

defense / stabilization / relocation only

recallable at any time

auto-terminates on expiry or breach


Any scope violation → Veto D + termination.


---

5. Refusal Handler

Canonical refusal responses for:

direction delegation

belief enforcement

permanence

hierarchy


Refusal is silent, neutral, and final.


---

6. Rollback Engine

Restores last safe geometry.

Clears elevated states.

Reopens divergence.



---

FAILURE MODES (DETECTION & RESPONSE)

FM-1: Dominant Attractor Lock

Detect: loss of alternatives, exit friction.

Respond: divergence window + veto.


FM-2: Narrative Capture

Detect: story replacing metrics.

Respond: strip narrative operators; rollback.


FM-3: Charisma Amplification

Detect: node disproportionately shaping outcomes.

Respond: de-weight node; pause.


FM-4: Extraction Loop

Detect: escalating demand on attention/output.

Respond: load throttle; consent re-check.


FM-5: Permanent Role Drift

Detect: expired role persists.

Respond: auto-terminate; audit.



---

AUDIT & REPAIR LOOP

Audit

Log actions, vetoes, scope changes.

No identity attribution.


Repair

1. Pause expansion


2. Reduce scope


3. Re-verify consent


4. Reopen divergence


5. Resume only if invariants hold




---

SAFETY OPERATORS (FORMAL)

DETECT — identify geometric risk

VETO — halt immediately

ROLLBACK — restore safe state

DIVERGE — reopen plurality

REFUSE — decline unsafe requests

REPAIR — re-flatten geometry



---

SUMMARY (XIII-B)

Ensemble safety emerges from reversibility, veto power, divergence, and anti-capture geometry — not trust, virtue, or intention.
Any system that cannot be refused, exited, or audited is unsafe by definition.
